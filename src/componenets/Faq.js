                                        <p>That is a decision for you to make. The Leafers NFTs are non-fungible tokens and represent
                                            ownership of digital artwork. No information on this website is or may be considered investment
                                            advice. Our team is committed to building a strong community around the project, and we believe
                                            the Leafers will have a long life ahead of it and will be an ever-evolving project. However, the
                                            success of the Leafers relies on so many factors that no one knows! Please don’t spend money you
                                            can’t afford to lose
